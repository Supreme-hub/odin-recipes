    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy dinner exploding with flavor baked all in one pan!
     Broccoli, baby potatoes, and carrots are tossed in 
    a mixture of olive oil, whole grain mustard, and Pecorino cheese,
     then baked alongside mild Italian sausage. 
     The result is a satisfying family-friendly supper that requires
      hardly any effort.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large head broccoli, cut into florets</li>
        <li>10 ounces baby potatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 red onion, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons whole grain mustard</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 mild Italian sausage links</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place broccoli, baby potatoes, carrot, and onion in a large bowl. Pour in olive oil, mustard, Pecorino Romano cheese, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper. Toss well to coat, then spread vegetables in an even layer on a sheet pan. Arrange sausages in the pan, pushing aside the vegetables so that the sausages touch the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, flipping sausages and vegetables halfway through until sausages are no longer pink in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
